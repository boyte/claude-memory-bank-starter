# Memory Bank Starter

Build applications at the speed of thought with Claude Code.

## Overview

Memory Bank Starter is a powerful project template that combines a hierarchical knowledge management system with AI agents to enable unprecedented development speed. Go from idea to working application in minutes, not hours.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Instant Scaffolding** - Create complete project structures in <30 seconds
- ðŸ¤– **AI Agents** - Specialized assistants for every development task
- ðŸ“š **Memory Bank** - Intelligent knowledge management system
- ðŸŽ¨ **Component Library** - Reusable UI components with design systems
- ðŸ”Œ **API Generator** - Create REST/GraphQL APIs in <1 minute
- ðŸ“¦ **Template Manager** - Deploy sites from templates in <2 minutes
- ðŸ§ª **Test Automation** - Comprehensive testing out of the box
- ðŸ“ˆ **Continuous Learning** - System improves with every use

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the starter
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-bank-starter.git
cd memory-bank-starter

# Initialize your project
node init-memory-bank.js

# Start building at lightning speed!
```

## Core Concepts

### ðŸ§  Memory Bank
The memory-bank is a hierarchical documentation system that serves as your project's institutional knowledge. It stores:
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- API documentation
- Component libraries
- Code examples
- Development history
- Issue tracking

Agents use this knowledge to generate code that follows your established patterns.

### ðŸ¤– AI Agents
Specialized AI assistants in `.claude/agents/` that handle specific tasks:
- **memory-bank-scaffold** - Project scaffolding
- **api-generator** - API generation
- **component-library-manager** - UI component management
- **memory-bank-template-manager** - Site template deployment
- And many more...

### ðŸ“¦ Templates
Pre-built, customizable site templates for rapid deployment:
- Landing pages
- E-commerce sites
- Dashboards
- Portfolios
- SaaS applications

## Speed Comparison

| Task | Traditional | With Memory Bank |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Project Setup | 30-60 min | <30 seconds |
| CRUD API | 2-4 hours | <1 minute |
| Component Library | 1-2 days | <5 minutes |
| Landing Page | 4-8 hours | <2 minutes |
| Full Application | 1-2 weeks | <1 day |

## How It Works

1. **Initialize** - Set up Memory Bank for your project
2. **Request** - Tell Claude what you want to build
3. **Generate** - Agents create code using proven patterns
4. **Iterate** - Refine and extend with natural language
5. **Learn** - System improves with every project

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start a new e-commerce project
"Create an e-commerce site with Next.js"

# 2. Claude uses multiple agents:
# - Scaffolds the project structure
# - Generates product API
# - Creates UI components
# - Sets up payment integration

# 3. Add features naturally
"Add user reviews to products"
"Create an admin dashboard"
"Add email notifications"

# Total time: <30 minutes for a complete e-commerce platform
```
